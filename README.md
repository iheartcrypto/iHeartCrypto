-
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on IHC/KCW Payments Systems + Interactive Apparel, 
- ğŸ”­ ....+Retail-Signage &  placards. That says HEY! That looks friendly! 
- ğŸ”­ ......."today will be my first time this "crypto" that
- ğŸ”­ ............everyone is talking about, for the last few years.
- 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning LOTS!
-
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on what's possible to bring
- ğŸ‘¯ Crypto into mainstream adoption.
-
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coding & logistics. 
- ğŸ¤” And why git is calling my repo ^ "special" idk?

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my German Shepherd/Belgian Malinois:

- ğŸ“« How to reach me: iHeartCrypto@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: Any Will Do. #Thickskin #Progressive #tollerance & #understanding
- âš¡ Fun fact: I prefer to remain pseudo anonomous. I go by "oG" - full pseudo is [redacted] because:
- âš¡ Alter Egos are fun. Mysterious. Banksy, Satoshi. I <3 Weird. #keepcryptoweird.
- âš¡ANOTHER: "fun fact" i've spent decades as a professional artist - I started with a CC 
- âš¡proccessing machine that had to be plugged into a land line to "batch out" dayly sales.
- âš¡Then the portable CC machines "Eureka!" expensive, fragile for traveling salespersons like myself
- âš¡but it was a revolution. Not everyone on the street circuit had one - the hardware, monthly serice
- âš¡fees etc made them not 100% adopted by small & micro-business
